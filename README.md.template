# Public speaker - Taivo Pungas

*Invite me to talk at your event.*

I often speak at events in Estonia and Europe, most often at technical or technology-related events. My typical topics are in the areas of:

* my experiences with applied machine learning and automating human activity at Veriff and Starship;
* the story of my [startup year](https://www.taivo.ai/startup-year/);
* building technology teams and products at NFTPort, Veriff, and my own startup attempts.

I've also given talks on non-tech topics like productivity, effective altruism, minimalism, and much more.

If you'd like to invite me to speak, please shoot me an email at [taivo@pungas.ee](mailto:taivo@pungas.ee).

Below is a list of all public speaking gigs I've done, ordered most recent to oldest.
